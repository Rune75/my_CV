## Selected Projects

### Subsea System for Measuring Stress and Fatigue in Steel Structures
**Employer:** Ferrx AS  
**Role:** Electronics Hardware and Software Developer  
The system consists of a control unit connected to one or more measurement probes over a proprietary serial data bus (25Mbs LVDS). Each measurement probe comprises 28 differential sensor inputs, ADC, and a 4-channel current excitation circuit. My tasks included developing and producing electronics, VHDL coding on FPGA and CPLD, as well as application and driver software on Linux, C, and shell scripts, and designing the internal mechanical solutions for the measurement probe.

### Steel Inspection System with Portable Measurement Instrument
**Employer:** Ferrx AS  
**Role:** Electronics, Hardware, and Software Developer  
The system comprises fixed sensors like those mentioned above and a portable measurement instrument that moves from sensor to sensor to measure and collect data. After measurements, the instrument connects to a PC application that collects, analyzes, and catalogs data from the sensors. I developed the encapsulation mechanics, electronics, embedded software, and low-level PC application software for signal processing, data collection, and storage, and contributed to the development of the PC application's user interface.

### High-Volume Test Systems for Toll Road Tags
**Employer:** Fenrits AS  
**Role:** Internal Project Manager and Developer  
The system consists of two test stations. In Station 1, the tags are tested in a manually operated jig while still in PCB panels of 3*3. My contribution was the system development and realization of all hardware and software (LabVIEW) for the station and writing service and user manuals. Station 2 is built around a conveyor where finished tags in plastic housings are tested and personalized via radio with a unique ID and barcode printing. My contribution was system development and realization of control and test software (Python), and writing service and user manuals.

## Other Experience
- Development of various test boards for testing Nordic Semiconductor’s products.  
- Writing design documentation, production documentation, and test procedures.  
- Qualification testing, antenna development, and production follow-up for toll road tags.  
- SW development on embedded Linux systems, ARM processors, Ferrx  
- Soldering and quality control of circuit boards from subcontractors, Ferrx, Norbit  
- Development of production test systems for various products, Norbit  
- Development of high-pressure tolerant electronics with soft encapsulation for subsea applications, Ferrx  
- Development of soldering methods for steel using induction, Ferrx  
- 3D CAD drawing for 3D printing of plastic parts, prototypes, and small series, Ferrx  

## Hobbies and Interests
- Family and house projects, small game hunting, hare hound  
- Various projects with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Homeassistant, etc.
